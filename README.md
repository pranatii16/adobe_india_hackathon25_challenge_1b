‚úÖ Round 1B: Persona-Driven Document Intelligence
We extended the system to support persona-based document analysis, which:

Accepts a collection of 3‚Äì10 PDFs

Accepts a persona definition and job-to-be-done

Extracts and prioritizes the most relevant sections for that persona‚Äôs goal

###Output Includes:
Metadata: persona, job-to-be-done, input filenames, and processing timestamp

Extracted Section: top-ranked section titles and page numbers

Sub-section Analysis: refined key points from those sections

### Example:
Persona: PhD Researcher in Computational Biology

Job: Prepare a literature review on GNNs for drug discovery

The system extracts and ranks content focused on:

Methodologies

Datasets

Performance benchmarks



### Docker Usage Instructions
 Build the Docker image
```sh

Copy code
docker build --platform linux/amd64 -t mysolution:uniqueid .
###Run the container
```
```sh
Copy code
docker run --rm \
  -v $(pwd)/input:/app/input \
  -v $(pwd)/output:/app/output \
  --network none mysolution:uniqueid
  ```
This will:

Process all PDFs inside /input

Generate corresponding .json output files in /output
